            cases the control connection may time out but before the server closes
            the connection it might send a 4xx response that was unexpected and
            can cause synchronization errors with transactions. To avoid this
            problem the <see cref="o:Execute"/> method checks to see if there is any data
            available on the socket before executing a command. On Azure hosting
            platforms this check can cause an exception to be thrown. In order
            to work around the exception you can set this property to false
            which will skip the test entirely however doing so eliminates the
            best effort attempt of detecting such scenarios. See this thread
            for more details about the Azure problem:

            When this value is set to true (default) the control connection
            is cloned and a new connection the server is established for the
            data channel operation. This is a thread safe approach to make
            asynchronous operations on a single control connection transparent
            to the developer.

            Gets a value indicating if this control connection is a clone. This property
            is used with data streams to determine if the connection should be closed
            when the stream is closed. Servers typically only allow 1 data connection
            per control connection. If you try to open multiple data connections this
            object will be cloned for 2 or more resulting in N new connections to the
            server.

            Passive data connection. EPSV is a better
            option if it's supported. Passive connections
            connect to the IP address dictated by the server
            which may or may not be accessible by the client
            for example a server behind a NAT device may
            give an IP address on its local network that
            is inaccessible to the client. Please note that IPv6
            does not support this type data connection. If you
            ask for PASV and are connected via IPv6 EPSV will
            automatically be used in its place.

            Same as PASV except the host supplied by the server is ignored
            and the data connection is made to the same address that the control
            connection is connected to. This is useful in scenarios where the
            server supplies a private/non-routable network address in the
            PASV response. It's functionally identical to EPSV except some
            servers may not implement the EPSV command. Please note that IPv6
            does not support this type data connection. If you
            ask for PASV and are connected via IPv6 EPSV will
            automatically be used in its place.

            the same as a PASV connection except the server

            the passive connection goes to the same address used
            in the control connection. This type of data connection

            Creates a listening socket on the client which
            requires firewall exceptions on the client system
            as well as client network when connecting to a
            server outside of the client's network. In addition
            the IP address of the interface used to connect to the
            server is the address the server is told to connect to
            which, if behind a NAT device, may be inaccessible to
            the server. This type of data connection is not supported
            by IPv6. If you specify PORT and are connected via IPv6
            EPRT will automatically be used instead.

            not know it has been disconnected if the remote host
            closes the connection first. Using Poll() avoids 
            the exception that would be thrown when trying to

            have a negative impact on performance. Setting this

            .NET SslStream doesn't close TLS connection properly.
            It does not send the close_notify alert before closing the connection.
            FtpSslStream uses unsafe code to do that.
            This is required when we want to downgrade the connection to plaintext using CCC command.
